# executive-name-match
Economics and business scholars often struggle with matching full executive names, particularly when dealing with unstructured or inconsistent formats (e.g., abbreviations and nicknames) in executive-related research. This repository offers a easy-to-use RAG-based solution to accurately link unstructured executive names to a structured database, minimizing the manual effort required for name matching and entity resolution.

# Requirement
A structured executive dataset: a CSV file containing year, CUSIP (or GVKEY as applicable), exec_fullname, execid, and title.
